                    <div class="weldesc">I'm Ben. <p>Reared in a small village in Devon, with a desire to learn & create, I ventured off to Cardiff University in 2014 to study a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Since returning, I have dabbled in areas such as environmental consultancy and data analysis, before discovering the joys of coding. After learning back end programming languages such as C++ and python, I stumbled upon the Odin project, and began my journey in web development.</p>

                <div class="listhobs">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drumming. I am an avid drummer - having done so for 20 years, and so it remains a steadfast hobby, when others come and go. I enjoy music from all genres - being in bands ranging from big bands, to metal, to contemporary.</li>
                        <li>Sport. Since school, I have been involved in all sports including football, rugby, and cricket. This lead me to becoming secretary of one of the university's rugby teams, as well as playing both all three sports for local teams.</li>
                        <li>Walking. Devon is a beautiful area - and so it would be one's duty to explore as much of it as possible. Thankfully, there are many public footpaths around Devon, and, coupled with Dartmoor's wondrous area of natural beauty, it makes walking one of my favourite pasttimes.</li>
